Challenges: 
  One challenge we faced was trying to make sure that we weren't overextending our capabilities or overstimulating the user with details while also trying to maintain the quality and authenticity of the experience.

Plans for next week:
  We plan on bringing the ideas we have on paper to life soon. We have comprehensive lists of everything we need to check off to ensure that the experience is what we want it to be and now we just have to execute it.
